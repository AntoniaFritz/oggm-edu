"OGGM-Edu was created as a \"side project\" of the larger `OGGM "
"<http://oggm.org>`_ consortium. It is now a somewhat independent and, we "
"hope, useful educational website. We are hoping to engage more content "
"creators and users! Here is what motivates us:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:11
msgid ""
"OGGM-Edu is an **interactive complement** to existing :ref:`online "
"resources <other_resources>`: OGGM-Edu offers \"hands-on\" and practical "
"activities, but only very little textbook content."

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:14
msgid ""
"The main themes we are currently working on are **glacier models** and "
"**global issues**: this has grown out of our own research interests and "
"expertise, but it doesn't have to always stay that way. We are open for "
"other topics as well!"

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:18
msgid "Our target groups are **instructors** and **independent learners**."

"We rely on an **open-source**, **decentralized** and **collaborative** "
"content creation system:"

"*open-source*: everything is available on online repositories and with an"
" open license allowing unrestrictive reuse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:24
msgid ""
"*decentralized*: content using OGGM-Edu or that can be run on OGGM-Edu "
"does not have to be stored on our repositories. For example, out `own "
"notebooks <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu-notebooks>`_ are stored in a "
"separate repository, and so are `Lizz' notebooks "
"<https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia>`_."

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:29
msgid ""
"*collaborative*: thanks to the decentralized open-source model, any new "
"modification and innovation can feed back to the original website, if the"
" author of the new content decided to allow it (which we strongly "
"encourage!)."

"We use **tools familiar to scientists**, who are not web developpers: our"
" apps and notebooks are written in the Python programming language, this "
"website is written in rst format. These tools are much easier to learn "
"and adapt for fellow scientists than, say, css or html. That way, we hope"
" to engage more people to use and develop the website further."
