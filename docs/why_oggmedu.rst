Why OGGM-Edu?
=============

OGGM-Edu was created as a "side project" of the larger `OGGM <http://oggm.org>`_
consortium. It is now a somewhat independent and, we hope,
useful educational website. We are hoping to engage more content creators
and users! Here is what motivates us:

- OGGM-Edu is an **interactive complement** to existing :ref:`online resources <other_resources>`:
  OGGM-Edu offers "hands-on" and practical activities, but only very little
  textbook content.
- The main themes we are currently working on are **glacier models** and
  **global issues**: this has grown out of our own research interests and expertise,
  but it doesn't have to always stay that way. We are open for other topics as
  well!
- Our target groups are **instructors** and **independent learners**.
- We rely on an **open-source**, **decentralized** and **collaborative**
  content creation system:

    - *open-source*: everything is available on online repositories
      and with an open license allowing unrestrictive reuse.
    - *decentralized*: content using OGGM-Edu or that can be run on OGGM-Edu
      does not have to be stored on our repositories. For example,
      out `own notebooks <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu-notebooks>`_ are
      stored in a separate repository, and so are
      `Lizz' notebooks <https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia>`_.
    - *collaborative*: thanks to the decentralized open-source model, any new
      modification and innovation can feed back to the original website,
      if the author of the new content decided to allow it (which we
      strongly encourage!).
- We use **tools familiar to scientists**, who are not web developpers: our apps and
  notebooks are written in the Python programming language, this website is
  written in rst format. These tools are much easier to learn and adapt for
  fellow scientists than, say, css or html. That way, we hope to engage more
  people to use and develop the website further.

If you want to know more, you can watch our recent seminar presentation
explaining these points into more detail and demonstrating some of OGGM-Edu's
applications:
